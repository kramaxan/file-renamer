# File Renamer

A simple file renamer. So far working on Windows, macOS and Linux, and only for media files: .png/.jpg images and .mp4 videos.

## Usage hint

At the stage of specifying the path to the folder with files, please specify the path to the directory where the folder itself is located without specifying its name and additional slashes at the end. Its name will be requested in the next step. By the way, it will serve as a common name for all files inside it.

## Installation

Clone the project and run:

    $ npm install

## How to run the project
